# Unitify

Once you unitify a page, all nouns on the page are replaced with the word "unit". As an AI student, I have been replacing nouns with the word "unit" since 2015 myself. This is a handy way to automate it.

## How to use it?
Haha, add it as a debug extension. Not sure if you will ever be able to 'officially' use it in firefox.

## Credits

Credits to [another AI student](https://github.com/flipflop97/unitify) for rekindling my idea for a unit automation browser extension.

The extension uses [wink pos-tagger](https://winkjs.org/).
